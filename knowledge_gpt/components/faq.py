## How does Vink GPT work?
The Vink article has been stored as a .txt file in this repo. This article is then divided into smaller chunks 
and stored in a special type of database called a vector index 
that allows for semantic search and retrieval.

When you ask a question to Vink GPT, it will search through the
article chunks and find the most relevant ones using the vector index.
Then, it will use the selected GPT model to generate a final answer.


## What do the numbers mean under each source?
With each answer from Vink GPT, you will see a citation number like this: 3-12. 
The first number is set to 1 because for now thereÂ´s just one article
and the second number is the chunk number.

## Are the answers 100% accurate?
No, the answers are not 100% accurate. Vink GPT uses GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT4 to generate
answers. These are powerful language models, but they sometimes makes mistakes 
and are prone to hallucinations. Also, Vink GPT uses semantic search
to find the most relevant chunks and does not see the entire article,
which means that it may not be able to find all the relevant information and
may not be able to answer all questions (especially summary-type questions
or questions that require a lot of context from the Vink article).

But for most use cases, Vink GPT is very accurate and can answer
most questions. Always check with the sources to make sure that the answers
are correct.
